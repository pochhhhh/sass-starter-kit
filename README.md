# sass-starter-kit

Make sure to have the following installed globally and locally to your project:

The purpose of this starter kit is to ease the creation of front end mock-ups, which
can be then be converted into WordPress themes later on. This starter kit has a Sass
file structure that resembles that of the Underscores WordPress starter theme.
The idea is to guide the developer into coding front end markup and styling that
adheres to best coding practices for WordPress theme development.

******************************************************************************************

Do not ever touch the style.css file or style.scss file. Modify the specific scss file
in question, such as _elements.scss instead. The generic style.css and style.scss is
only used to import from other more specified styling files.
